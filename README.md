In Australia, it's easy to put off a trip to the dentist until something hurts. But by then, a small problem can become a big, painful, and expensive one. At Butler Medical Imaging, we want to help you get ahead of the pain. We believe in being proactive about your dental health with a simple OPG scan service.
What Is a Dental OPG Scan and Why Is It So Important?
An OPG (short for Orthopantomogram) is a specialised type of X-ray that captures a single image of your entire mouth. Think of it like a panoramic photo of your teeth, jaw, and the bones around them. Unlike a normal dental X-ray that looks at just one tooth, an OPG gives your dentist a full view. This is key to finding hidden problems that are impossible to see during a regular check-up.
In Australia, many people have tooth problems without even knowing it. A routine check-up might catch a cavity on the surface, but a thorough OPG scan service can find so much more.
What Can an OPG Scan Find Before You Feel Pain?
A preventive OPG scan service is like a health check for your mouth. It can find:
1.	Troublesome Wisdom Teeth: Your wisdom teeth might be growing sideways or getting stuck. An OPG scan shows their exact position, so your dentist can act early to stop future pain and damage.
2.	Jawbone Problems: An OPG is a great way to check the health of your jaw. It can find things like cysts or early signs of bone loss that you wouldn't know about otherwise.
3.	Hidden Cavities and Infections: Decay can hide in places your dentist can’t see, like between your teeth. The detailed picture from an OPG can expose these hidden issues, helping you get them fixed before you need more serious treatment.
4.	Planning for a Better Smile: If you're thinking about braces or dental implants, an OPG scan service is the first step. It gives your dentist a complete map of your mouth, helping them plan the best treatment for you.
